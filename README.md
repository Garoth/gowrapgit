# Go Wrap Git

This project provides a Go API to common Git functions. It is implemented
as a simple `git` command shell wrapper, so it doesn't have any complex
dependencies.

If you're looking for a much more complete and down-to-the-metal implementation,
I recommend looking at https://github.com/libgit2/git2go. This project wraps
around libgit2 directly.

## Project Status

Generally pretty alpha. I'm basically just adding functions as I need them
for other projects. You can expect it to have just the bare minimum for now.
